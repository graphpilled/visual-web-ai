In a future version of Bundler, running `bundle` without argument will no longer run `bundle install`.
Instead, the `cli_help` command will be displayed. Please use `bundle install` explicitly for scripts like CI/CD.
You can use the future behavior now with `bundle config set default_cli_command cli_help --global`,
or you can continue to use the current behavior with `bundle config set default_cli_command install --global`.
This message will be removed after a default_cli_command value is set.
